The data loaded from the CSV files
Each dataset explored - columns, counts, basic stats
The domain context understood and explored with underlying patterns in the data
Answered the folowing questions:
  What is the mean value of daily yield?
  What is the total irradiation per day?
  What is the max ambient and module temperature?
  How many inverters are there for each plant?
  What is the maximum/minimum amount of DC/AC Power generated in a time interval/day?
  Which inverter (source_key) has produced maximum DC/AC power?
  Rank the inverters based on the DC/AC power they produce
  Is there any missing data?
Even with very limitted data, an arima example run for yield prediction
